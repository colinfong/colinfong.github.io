                  <p>Students. More students. And even more students.</p>

In fact, some of us are feeling the heat right now, with the recent surge of admitted freshmen due to the University of California’s pledge to enroll 10,000 more California residents between 2016 and 2019.</p>

                  <p>A Daily Bruin news story published on Oct. 4, 1967, talks about how due to over-enrollment in lower division classes, the Student Book Department was facing a massive shortage of certain textbooks. According to then-Student Book Department manager, Wallace Ruggeri, heightened lower division class sizes and faculty tardiness in submitting book lists were the reasons for the textbook dilemma.</p>
